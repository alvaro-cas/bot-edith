# Bot Edith

## Introduction
This is a basic conversational bot that uses Bayes Theorem. Currently working in Spanish, you can change `learner.js` (common ways of making questions), `answers.js` (Edith answers) and [model](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) (unpack as 'model' on current folder) to your desired language.
